# Bouncing Balls Physics Simulation

An interactive physics simulation of bouncing balls created with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Features

- Realistic ball physics with collision detection and response
- Click and drag interaction to move balls
- Throw balls with momentum based on drag speed
- Multiple colored balls with different initial positions
- Elastic collisions between balls
- Wall collision detection and bouncing

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click and hold on any ball to drag it
3. Release the ball to throw it
4. Watch the balls interact with realistic physics

## Technical Details

- Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Implements velocity-based physics
- Features elastic collision response
- Includes position correction to prevent ball overlap
- Maintains momentum conservation in collisions

## Controls

- Click and hold: Grab a ball
- Drag: Move the selected ball
- Release: Throw the ball with velocity based on movement
